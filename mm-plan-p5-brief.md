# Implementation Task: Music Manager Competitor Dashboard

## Task Overview

You are tasked with implementing a specific section of the Competitor Dashboard for the Music Manager application. This implementation is part of Phase 5 of the project development plan. You will be implementing **Step [X]** from the detailed implementation plan.

## Project Context

The Music Manager is a Next.js application designed for Ice Skaters to upload and manage music files for competitions. The application has two primary user roles:

- **Admin**: Manages competitions, grades, and users
- **Competitor**: Uploads and manages music files for competitions

The application uses:

- Next.js 15+ with TypeScript and App Router
- Appwrite for backend services (using server-side Node.js SDK)
- shadcn/UI components for the UI
- Server Actions for API functionality
- Functional programming approach

Phases 1-4 of the project have already been implemented, which include:

- Environment setup and project scaffolding
- Appwrite configuration
- Authentication and user management
- Admin Dashboard development

You are now working on Phase 5: Competitor Dashboard Development.

## Your Specific Task

Please implement **Step [X]: [Step Title]** from the detailed implementation plan found in `mm-plan-p5.md`.

### Instructions

1. **Review the Implementation Plan**: First, carefully read through the entire `mm-plan-p5.md` file to understand the overall architecture and approach.

2. **Focus on Step [X]**: Pay special attention to Section [X] in the implementation plan, which details the specific components, functions, and files you need to create or modify.

3. **Understand the Context**: Each section in the implementation plan includes context information that explains how this step fits into the overall application. Make sure you understand this context before proceeding.

4. **Follow the Code Examples**: The implementation plan provides code examples for each component or function. Use these as a starting point, but feel free to improve them if you see opportunities for better code organization, performance, or readability.

5. **Maintain Consistency**: Ensure your implementation follows the patterns and conventions established in the previous phases and other parts of the Competitor Dashboard.

6. **Implement Server-Side Operations**: All operations should use Appwrite's server-side Node.js SDK and Server Actions, not client-side API calls.

7. **Test Your Implementation**: After implementing the code, provide instructions on how to test that your implementation works correctly.

### Key Considerations

- **Server-Side Operations**: All Appwrite operations must use the server-side Node.js SDK.
- **TypeScript**: Use proper TypeScript types for all components and functions.
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling with toast notifications using the `sonner` package.
- **UI Consistency**: Maintain UI consistency with the rest of the application, using shadcn/UI components.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure all UI components work well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Code Organization**: Follow the established project structure and code organization patterns.

## Deliverables

Please provide:

1. All code files needed to implement Step [X]
2. A brief explanation of how your implementation works
3. Any notes on integration with other parts of the application
4. Instructions for testing the implementation
