# Music Manager Implementation Brief

## Overview

This brief provides instructions for implementing a specific step from the Phase 4 Admin Dashboard Development plan of the Music Manager project. The implementation should follow the technology stack and approaches defined in the main project documentation.

## Instructions

1. Please implement Step [X] from the detailed implementation plan located in `mm-plan-p4.md` in the project repository.

2. Read the full details of Step [X] in the implementation plan to understand:

   - The objective of this step
   - The deliverables required
   - The technical implementation details
   - Any relevant context from the main project plan

3. Ensure your implementation:

   - Uses the Appwrite server-side Node.js SDK for all database operations
   - Follows the server actions pattern for API calls
   - Maintains the modern, colorful styling consistent with the rest of the application
   - Uses the sonner package for toast notifications
   - Implements proper error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Is responsive on both desktop and mobile devices
   - Follows the project's functional programming approach
   - Creates modern, stylish and colourful interfaces

4. The implementation should be delivered as working code that can be integrated into the existing project structure without breaking other components.

5. Focus only on implementing the specific step assigned and maintain clear interfaces to ensure it will work with the other steps when they are implemented.

## Technical Reminders

- Use the `sonner` package for toast notifications
- Confirm all destructive operations with modal dialogs
- Ensure proper loading states are displayed during async operations
- Follow TypeScript best practices and provide proper type definitions
- Test the implementation for both happy and error paths
- Remember all API operations should use the server-side Node.js SDK and server actions

## Additional Resources

- Refer to `/Docs/AppwriteAPI/appwrite-database-server-api.md` for Appwrite server-side database API examples
- Refer to `/Docs/default-grades.ts` for default grade structures
- Check the authentication implementation in Phase 3 for role-based routing

## Deliverables

1. All required component files as specified in Step [X]
2. Any necessary server actions files
3. Updates to the main dashboard page if needed
4. Any additional helper utilities or types required

## Testing Guidance

Before submitting the implementation, please verify:

- All components render without errors
- Data fetching and submission work correctly
- Error states are handled properly
- The UI matches the design guidelines
- The implementation works with the rest of the application
